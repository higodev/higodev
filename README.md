### Hi there 👋

**higodev/higodev** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hello, my name is Higo! I am a simple companion, enthusiastic about technology, moved to the challenges, a student of Computer Science, with more than 5 years of experience in IT as a developer, systems analyst and support to ERP projects. Today I have fun with Java for Web, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Apache Tomcat, Thymeleaf and, starting with Angular, I usually use Git versions, relational databases (SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres) and Linux and Windows.
